# income_analysis
As a result of the increasing population and technological developments, there is a large amount of stored data. The analysis and conversion of these data into information has become important. Data mining and machine learning techniques can be used for income determination analysis. In this study, the probability of estimating the income level based on a certain data set created in the USA was examined. The study was conducted on the UCI Adult Census Income data set. The data set was extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 census database. The level of education, age, gender, profession, etc. of the individual. The annual income with 14 features such as <= 50K and> 50K is divided into two classes. Decision Trees, Artificial Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting and CatBoost classification methods were applied. As a result of the application, the CatBoost algorithm was 87.27% more accurate than other machine learning methods. The Gradient Boosting algorithm gave the closest result to CatBoost with an accuracy of 86.58%. The K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm gave the lowest result with an accuracy of 83.08%. To improve CatBoost's success, the data set is balanced by applying SMOTE. As a result, the CatBoost algorithm yielded an accuracy of 90.51%.
